Type of source media: CD–ROM Source scale denominator: 3000000 Source contribution: Attribute and geospatial data GMI (source 2 of 2) Global Mapping International, Missions Database: Global Mapping International, Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA. Type of source media: CD–ROM Source contribution: Attribute data Date: 20010111 (change 1 of 3) The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the features from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 1999 data set-admin98.shp. Updated political boundaries for countries and first-level administrative units. Used Continent attribute to dissolve out the necessary features to create the continents. Removed unnecessary attributes. Created ArcGIS® layer file (.lyr). Created projection file (.prj). Created spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC. Data sources used in this process: ArcWorld Supplement GMI Date: 20040307 (change 2 of 3) The following steps were performed by ESRI: Added SQKM attribute and calculated its values. Added SQMI attribute and calculated its values. Date: 20050211 (change 3 of 3) The following steps were performed by ESRI: Removed the Paracel and Spratly island groups.</history>
