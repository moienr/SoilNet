# SoilNet

A hybrid multi-model DL model for soil property (SOC) prediction has been presented. The training consists of two phases: 1) Self-supervised contrastive learning and 2) supervised fine-tuning via ground truth for our downstream task, which is regression.

### Ground Truth
Our model has been trained via two different datasets:
- LUCAS:
- RaCA:
