# SoilNet

A hybrid multi-model DL model for soil property (SOC) prediction has been presented. The training consists of two phases: 1) Self-supervised contrastive learning and 2) supervised fine-tuning via ground truth for our downstream task, which is regression.

### Ground Truth
Our model has been trained via two different datasets:
- LUCAS: To access the LUCAS topsoil dataset (ground truth), visit: [LUCAS Topsoil Dataset](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/topsoil-physical-properties-europe-based-lucas-topsoil-data)
- RaCA: To access the RaCA dataset (ground truth), visit: [RaCA Dataset]((https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/resources/data-and-reports/rapid-carbon-assessment-raca))
